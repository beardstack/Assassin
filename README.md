**Copyright 2022 V0LT - Conner Vieira**

A driving assistant designed to detect and mitigate threats while driving.


## Note

Assassin is currently a work in progress, so consider the descriptions and features below to be a preview of what's planned. Everything is subject to change.


## Disclaimer

While Assassin is designed to be as safe as possible, it's always the driver's responsibility to drive safely and attentively. Do not use Assassin in a context where you could be distracted from the road, and do not use Assassin as a replacement for your own attention.


## Description

Assassin is a system designed to be your driving copilot by detecting and mitigating potential hazards like speed cameras, potholes, and more. During normal driving, Assassin works in the background as a dashboard, displaying basic, customizable information on screen. However, when a potential hazard or threat is encountered, Assassin alerts the driver, and suggests a solution to mitigate the problem.


## General Features

### Lightweight

Assassin is extremely lightweight, and is designed to work on a Raspberry Pi.

### Offline

Assassin is capable of operating entirely offline, meaning it can go anywhere your car does regardless of network connectivity.

### Repairable

Assassin follows a philosophy of repairability by providing the user with everything they need to diagnose and resolve problems independently.

### Open Source

Assasin is free and open source from top to bottom, and is 'free software', meaning you can make changes and distribute them to others freely.

### Generic

By design, Assassin doesn't require specialized hardware to run. Regardless of whether you use inexpensive hardware to save money, or a high end system to improve performance, Assassin will make the most of what it has to work with.

### Easy

While being technically mindedly will certainly help, Assassin doesn't require professional installation or setup to function. As long as you're reasonably experienced with the Linux command line and automotive electronics, installing assassin should only take a few hours at most.

### Private

Since Assassin is open source, self hosted, offline, and self contained, you can rest assured that it's completely private, and it doesn't collect any of the information you provide it.

### Customizable

Assassin is extremely customizable, making it easy to fit into your driving style and needs.

### Mobile

Assassin is designed to support low-energy-usage hardware such that it can be easily installed in a vehicle. A single USB port is enough to power an entire Assassin system.

### Safe

Assassin is designed to be safe, regardless of the installation context. It's easy to configure Assassin to completely hands free, ensuring that you don't have to look away from the road.

### Documented

Assasin's extreme customizability can be a bit overwhelming to new users. For this reason, the entire platform is extensively documented, and comes bundled with step-by-step guides on how to download it, install it, configure it, and run it.
